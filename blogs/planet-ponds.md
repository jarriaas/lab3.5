# **Planet of Ponds**
## Captain Bruce - Ship Starstride | Log #14

Today's cosmic adventure was to something I dubbed as the "Planet of Ponds." As our spacecraft flew over this world, I couldn't help but marvel at the sight before us. The planet's surface was full of glistening water, scattered around with flowers atop its spongy terrain. The water made landing a hassle to navigate, but the amount of flower logs we will receive from this trip will make Galactic Hub proud. Here are a few we wanted to share:

Flower Species #2: _Petite and vibrant. Shades of cerulean blue. Petals have tiny black polka-dots. Stems are slender and arching._

Flower Species #5: _Velvety crimson hue. Petals lined with golden edges. Stems are sturdy and difficult to snap._


Flower Species #11: _Low to the ground. Petals long and scarlet-turquoise gradient. Limited stemming, flower is rooted by its petals._
