# **Star of Melodies**
## Captain Mark - Ship Galaxia | Log #21


Yo yo yo. Captain Mark here, your #1 Star Guide. Corporate wanted me to be more formal in these Galactic Logs but there's no way they can fire me, so why bother?

Anyway, I was driving my ship around and started to hear some sounds I haven't heard in a while. Instead of the usual beeping and clicking, I heard something... pretty.

Lo and behold, it's a star. That's why they call me the Star Guy, I have a knack for fiding these things. 

This star was easy to land on. There was absolutely nothing on it. I guess all this star has to offer is pretty music. I'm not complaining though, it was pretty relaxing. I sat there listening to cool melodies while kicking back and reading my Space Mag from last month. 

Here is my recap. Star of Melodies: *has melodies.* Enjoy, Galactic Hub.
